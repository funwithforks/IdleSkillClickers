# Idle Skilling Clickers
Making some clickers to play Idle Skilling - Linux only for now.  
Work on the Python version has begun. It doesn't work yet.  
I have a partially made clicker made in bash. It has a lot of assumptions about what you are doing and how far you are in the game. It's mostly for my own personal use.
