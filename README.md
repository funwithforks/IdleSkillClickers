# IdleSkillClickers
Making some clickers to play Idle Skilling - Linux only for now.
I'm starting one in bash. After I add a few farms, I will change it to have a bunch of timers and farm everything that is enabled by going to different pages when the timer is up, and queue up events when timers are up during an action.
There is no good reason to do this in bash. I'm going to redo it in python next and maybe also add Wondows support in that one.
